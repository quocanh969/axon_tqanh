In this challenge I use React JS to code. This guideline is about how to start and build the project from source code.

*To start project:
- run command line: npm install
-> install library which is help in routing and state management.

- run command line: npm start 
-> to start project in http://localhost:3000

*To build project:
- run command line: npm run build 
-> Builds the app for production to the "build" folder

*To run test for project:
- I am very sorry that I not write Unit Test in this challenge because I have no experience in writing Unit test in my other jobs before.
So for me to do it, I will need time to research but I read that you guys hope it won't take much time for this.
Therefore, I just did manual test coverage for the requirements.
